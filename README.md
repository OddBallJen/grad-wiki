# "How to Not Screw up Grad School" - an (unofficial) RPI Grad Wiki

## DISCLAIMER
This is a community-sourced project, by RPI Grads for RPI Grads, aimed to share history and insights on how to navigate the world-renowned Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, and beyond.

We do our best to fact-check all entries, but to err is human. Thus, _all information provided and advice given in this Wiki comes without any warranty, whatsoever_. Please double-check before taking action.

## Why a Wiki?
Generally, all experience we accumulate during our stay at RPI leaves with us when we graduate. Through this Wiki, we want to reduce the repetitive trial/error struggles many of us go through when starting out, accelerating our progress towards the finish line (=degree).

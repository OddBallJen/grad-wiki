# "How to not screw up Grad School" - an RPI Grad Wiki

## Overview

This is a community-sourced project, aimed to maintain and share knowledge on how to navigate Troy, Rensselaer, and beyond. 

Generally, all of the experience we accumulate during our stay at RPI leaves with us when we graduate. Through this Wiki, we hope to reduce the repetitive trial/error struggles many of us go through when starting out, accelerating our progress towards the finish line (=degree).

Each of us knows something the others do not. If you wish to contribute, send an email to grad-council@rpi.edu .

## Instructions

Files in this Wiki are written in markdown and can be opened with any plain text editor, e.g. _Notepad_. However, for the complete functionality, it is best to use either [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), or [LogSeq](https://logseq.com/) note-taking applications for navigating the Wiki.

## Folder Structure

- _pages_: Contains the actual Wiki.
- _assets_: All supplementary materials (pdfs, images, etc.), which can be linked by other notes/folders in _pages_.
- _obsidian_, _logseq_: configurations, needed by the note-taking applications.

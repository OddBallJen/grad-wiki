# "How to Not Screw up Grad School" - an (unofficial) RPI Grad Wiki

## DISCLAIMER
This is a community-sourced project, by RPI Grads for RPI Grads, aimed to maintain and share knowledge on how to navigate the world-renowned Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, and beyond. Each of us knows something others do not - if you want to either contribute knowledge, or help manage & maintain the project, email [grad-council+grad-wiki@rpi.edu](mailto:grad-council+grad-wiki@rpi.edu).

We do our best to fact-check all entries, but to err is human. Thus, _all information provided and advice given in this Wiki comes without any warranty, whatsoever_. Please double-check before taking action.

## Why a Wiki?
Generally, all experience we accumulate during our stay at RPI leaves with us when we graduate. Through this Wiki, we hope to reduce the repetitive trial/error struggles many of us go through when starting out, accelerating our progress towards the finish line (=degree).

## Instructions
This Wiki is written in [MarkDown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/markdown), the _.md_ files can be opened with any plain text editor, e.g. _Notepad_. However, for complete functionality, we recommend viewing/navigating it using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) note-taking applications. You can also try [LogSeq](https://logseq.com/), or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as open-source alternatives.

### Folders
- _pages_: Contains the actual Wiki.
- _assets_: All supplementary materials (pdfs, images, etc.), which can be linked by other notes/folders in _pages_.
- _obsidian_, _logseq_: Configurations, needed by note-taking applications.

If you want to explore Downtown Troy, here is a small list of places you can go in your free time!

---
- [Market Block Books](https://www.bhny.com/)- a small and cute bookstore located on the corner of River Street and 3rd Street. With a substantial variety of genres ranging from Mystery to Cooking and staff recommendations, there is always something for everyone!
- [Uncle Sam Lanes](https://unclesamlanes.com/) - a bowling arena located on the corner of 6th Avenue and Fulton Street, right next to Blitman Residence Hall. Ranging from $3.50 to $5 per person per game, it is a rather affordable way to spend a night out!
- [Prospect Park](https://www.troyny.gov/1414/Prospect-Park) - a beautiful park off of Congress Street that has multiple different courts for most sports of your choosing!

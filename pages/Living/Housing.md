## Off-Campus Housing

RPI offers a wonderful resource on [Off-Campus Housing for Students](https://sll.rpi.edu/campus-commons/campus-information-students) that includes rental listings, roommate/ sublet postings, a student guide and resources, bus information, and legal services.

Before you begin your search, download the off-campus housing checklist from the link above, right hand side of the page.

Here's a roadmap of some RPI offices that can help with stuff.

## Important People on Campus


## Office of Graduate Education

The [Office of Graduate Education (OGE)](https://graduate.rpi.edu/) provides support for Graduate students especially in the academic area, including communication between the academic and administration parties. 

> Importantly, they also offer a variety of [Useful Information](https://graduate.rpi.edu/information-students) both for new-coming students and for continually keeping up with the info on **housing, healthcare, course registration, payroll, discounts**, and other.

See also their page on [Student Life and Community](https://graduate.rpi.edu/graduate-experience/student-life-and-community) with other useful tips!

## ISSS (for International Students)

If you're **an international student**, you will inevitably interact with the members of the [International Services for Students and Scholars](https://info.rpi.edu/isss). They will provide all the necessary help with your visa documents, setting up your social security number, but also settling in and establishing a community during your stay at RPI through various events.

>Don't forget that if you leave the US during your stay, **you need the ISSS's signature on your I-20**. Without their signature, you **would not be able to reenter the country**. 

We should add that the office is very helpful and friendly so do not hesitate to contact them with anything you need.

A list of things they can help with:
- They organize an **orientation** for new-coming students and provide them with valuable advice and socialization tips.
- Counseling for the international students' permits and opportunities to **work**, both on campus and off campus. 
- They provide a basic checklist to help with **taxes**. 
- You also need to consult with them in case you **change or leave** your program. Changes in your status need to be reflected in your I-20.
- For more, feel free to [contact the ISSS](https://info.rpi.edu/isss/isss-news/#ServicesAdvising) or visit their office.
## Health & Counseling Center

Medical care can be a tricky business when you're dealing with a transition to Graduate life. For many of your health concerns, you can visit the [Health Center](https://studenthealth.rpi.edu/) if you need **a check-up, a prescription, or if you are struggling with some health problems**. 

>Part of the Health Center is the [**Student Health Portal**](https://rpi.studenthealthportal.com/) where you can schedule your appointments online with no additional hassle. 

The good news is that since you are paying a health center fee, all your visits will be free of charge, so do not hesitate to use the facility outside of your insurance. The office is located in Academy Hall.

A part of the Health Center is the [Counseling Center](https://studenthealth.rpi.edu/list-services/counseling-center), which offers mental health care including psychiatric care and a variety of counseling options. 

>The Counseling Center also organizes different wellness and awareness programs, including drop-in counseling hours. 
## Students with Families

The student community provides community and support for students with families. To start, you can check out [RPI Resources for students with families](https://graduate.rpi.edu/information-students) offered by the OGE.
